=head1 NAME

postctf - plugin interface for postctf (post config file installation) programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example:

  #!/bin/sh
  exec my_apply_new_config_prog "$1"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A postctf program is hooked in to the deployment of a new version
of a configuration file by ctf(1).  It is executed after the file
has been deployed.  Its purpose is typically to
apply the new configuration, for example by restarting a daemon
or by rebuilding a derived file.

When the user supplies a "postctf" program for a file deployed
by L<ctf(1)>, by 
specifying it for that file in L<ctf.conf(5)>, the postctf program
should implement the following interface.

=head2 ARGUMENTS

The first argument is the path to the configuration file
that's changed.

=head2 EXIT CODES

The postctf should exit zero on success, or non-zero on failure.

Exiting non-zero will result in L<ctf(1)> attempting to back out
the just-installed configuration file to its previous version.
It will also result in deferred overall failure of L<ctf(1)>.   L<ctf(1)>
will continue to deploy remaining configuration files, so long as
they don't depend on a file whose postctf has failed.

L<etr(1)> may be useful if you're trying to write a one-liner that
execs a program, such as diff, where there are non-zero exit
codes that don't indicate an error.

=head1 CAVEATS

L<etr(1)> hasn't been specified or implemented yet.
