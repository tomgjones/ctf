=head1 NAME

postctf - plugin interface for postctf programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/bin/sh
  exec my_validate_prog "$1"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A postctf program is hooked in to the deployment of a new version
of a configuration file by ctf(1).  Its purpose is typically to
apply the new configuration, for example by restarting a daemon
or by rebuilding a derived file.

When the user supplies a "postctf" program for a file deployed
by L<ctf(1)>, by 
specifying it for that file in L<ctf.conf(5)>, the postctf program
should implement the following interface.

=head2 ARGUMENTS

The first argument is the path to the configuration file
that's changed.

=head2 EXIT CODES

The postctf should exit zero on success, or non-zero on failure.

L<etr(1)> may be useful if you're trying to write a one-liner that
execs a program, such as diff, where there are non-zero exit
codes that don't indicate an error.
