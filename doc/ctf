=head1 NAME

ctf - configuration file deployer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ctf [PATH ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Deploys managed configuration files from the configured repository
as specified in L<ctf.conf(5)>.

ctf expects to find a L<ctf.manifest(5)> directly
in the top level content directory.
The configuration files to deploy are found in subdirectories of the
content directory; each of these subdirectories is called a component.

If PATH ... is supplied, only files under those paths are
deployed.

By default, when a file's content is changed, a backup copy of the
file is taken.  The backup file's name is based on the main file's
name, but with a . prepended and ".ctfprev" appended.  The backup
file path can be overridden or disabled per file (see L<ctf.manifest(5)>),
or backup files can be disabled altogether (see --no-backups below).
