=head1 NAME

ctf - configuration file deployer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ctf [PATH ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Deploys managed configuration files from the configured repository
as specified in L<ctf.conf(5)>.

ctf expects to find a L<ctf.manifest(5)> in the repository.  The
configuration files to deploy are found in subdirectories of the
repository; each of these subdirectories is called a component.

If PATH ... is supplied, only files under those paths are
deployed (not implemented).

=head2 OPTIONS

Use CF as the configuration file.  The default configuration file is
/etc/ctf/ctf.conf for root, or ~/.ctf.conf for other users.

=item -t,--test

Report on what would be deployed, but don't do it.  Doesn't
execute any content from the repository, such as prectf programs.

=item -p,--pre

Execute prectf programs.  This is normally the default, but
not so when --test is given.

=item -P,--nopre

Don't execute prectf programs.
