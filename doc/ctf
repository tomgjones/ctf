=head1 NAME

ctf - configuration file deployer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ctf [PATH ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Deploys managed configuration files from the configured repository
as specified in L<ctf.conf(5)>.

ctf expects to find a L<ctf.manifest(5)> directly
in the top level content directory.
The configuration files to deploy are found in subdirectories of the
content directory; each of these subdirectories is called a component.

If PATH ... is supplied, only files under those paths are
deployed (not implemented).

Don't execute prectf programs.

=item -T,--nopost

=item -s,--safe

Report on what would be changed, without executing any content from

There must be an equal number
of C<--comp> and C<--comp-loc>; they are paired up in order.
