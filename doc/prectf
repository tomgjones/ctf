=head1 NAME

prectf - plugin interface for prectf programs prectf (pre config file installation) programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example:

  #!/bin/sh
  exec my_validate_prog "$1"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A prectf program is hooked in to the deployment of a new version
of a configuration file by ctf(1).  It is executed before the file
has been deployed.  Its purpose is typically to validate
the new configuration.

When the user supplies a "prectf" program for a file deployed
by L<ctf(1)>, by 
specifying it for that file in L<ctf.conf(5)>, the prectf program
should implement the following interface.

=head2 ARGUMENTS

The first argument is the path to the new version of the configuration file
that's about to be changed.  The path is not to the final
destination of the configuration file; it is to the location
of the version of the configuration file in ctf(1)'s content
directory.

=head2 EXIT CODES

The prectf should exit zero on success, or non-zero on failure.

Exiting non-zero will result in L<ctf(1)> declining to attempt
installation of the new version of the file.  It
will also result in deferred overall failure of L<ctf(1)>.   L<ctf(1)>
will continue to deploy remaining configuration files, so long as
they don't depend on a file whose prectf has failed.

L<etr(1)> may be useful if you're trying to write a one-liner that
execs a program, such as diff, where there are non-zero exit
codes that don't indicate an error.

=head1 CAVEATS

L<etr(1)> hasn't been specified or implemented yet.
